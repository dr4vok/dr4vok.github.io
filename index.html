    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m dravok, a Web Application Security Specialist.

With a background in OSCP‑level training and solving all PortSwigger labs (OWASP Top‑10), I focus on identifying real risks in web apps — SQLi, XSS, business logic, API authorization, and more. I code in Python, Bash, and C, and continuously refresh my skills in modern JavaScript and HTML.

My mission is to help small businesses and startups secure their web presence with professional, honest, and easy‑to‑understand reports, in both English and Arabic. No fluff, just actionable findings.</p>
